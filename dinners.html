      <h2 class="dinner-head">Spaghetti Bolognese (Italy)</h2>
    <p>
      Spaghetti Bolognese is a quintessential Italian dish, hailing from the city of Bologna. This hearty meal is made with a slow-cooked meat sauce, traditionally called ragu alla bolognese, and served over pasta. The sauce is prepared using ground beef or pork, simmered with tomatoes, onions, garlic, carrots, celery, and Italian herbs such as basil, oregano, and thyme. Red wine and a bit of milk or cream are often added for depth and richness, creating a velvety texture. Although it's commonly served over spaghetti outside of Italy, Italians prefer pairing the ragu with wider noodles like tagliatelle or pappardelle, as the sauce clings better to these pasta shapes. Topped with freshly grated Parmesan cheese and a sprinkle of parsley or basil, this dish embodies the warmth and tradition of Italian family meals. While simple in concept, Spaghetti Bolognese showcases the importance of time and patience in developing rich, comforting flavors.
